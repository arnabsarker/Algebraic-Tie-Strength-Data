# Bridge Data
Data used for identifying tie strength in social networks. Each dataset contains a set of edges and a set of triangles, where the triangles represent distinct higher order interactions among groups of three individuals. Datasets also include a file `clique_tlist.csv` which enumerates the triangles generated by the graph represented in `edges.csv`
